# Mission Control — pushing a mission site from an agent session

Mission Control (`/mission-control`) hosts chromeless native sites, one per
mission, with immutable revision history. P1 scope: missions + site hosting
only. Resources, Q&A, and live data feeds arrive with their own phases —
if you're looking for those, they aren't here yet.

Dashboard base URL: `https://localhost:8080` on host-network sessions,
`https://host.docker.internal:8080` from bridge-network containers (`curl -sk`).

Unlike Present, there is **one store, one obvious content route, and no
separate publish step**. A push both stores the revision and makes it
current, atomically.

## 1. Create a mission (once)

```bash
curl -sk https://host.docker.internal:8080/api/missions \
  -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "OSS Insights", "coordinator_session": "'$AUTONOMY_SESSION'"}'
# → 201 {"mission": {"mission_id": "<uuid>", "name": "...", "coordinator_session": "...", "created_at": ..., "current_revision_id": null}}
```

The entity is deliberately minimal — `{mission_id, name, coordinator_session,
created_at}`. `coordinator_session` is plain data, not an invariant: it isn't
hard-bound anywhere in P1 and can go stale if the coordinator session is
replaced. There is no PATCH for it yet; that lands with P2 (the Q&A relay
reads it at message time).

## 2. Push a site revision (the only call you need per update)

```bash
curl -sk https://host.docker.internal:8080/api/missions/<mission_id>/site \
  -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"html": "<full self-contained HTML>", "note": "rev11: code-verification pass folded in"}'
# → 201 {"revision": {"revision_id": "<uuid>", "mission_id": "...", "revision_seq": 11, "note": "...", "created_at": ...}}
```

`note` is optional but recommended — it's the one-line description that
shows up in the revision history list, and it's free now, annoying to
retrofit later. This call **is** the publish step. There is nothing else to
call afterward.

Handler: `push_site_revision` in
`tools/dashboard/plugins/mission_control/entrypoints/api.py`, backed by
`tools.dashboard.dao.mission_control_db.push_site_revision` — appends an
immutable revision (`revision_seq = MAX+1`) and updates the mission's
current-revision pointer in the same transaction.

## 3. View it

```
https://host.docker.internal:8080/missions/<mission_id>
```

Chromeless — raw HTML, no dashboard furniture, stable across every future
push. The response is marked uncacheable end to end
(`Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0`) and always
reads the current revision fresh from storage: a push is visible on the next
request, with no caching window to wait out.

Your HTML is served as-is, unlike Present's viewer — there is **no iframe
rebuild, no injected Tailwind/Alpine CDN, no scroll-snap slide chopping**.
Ship a complete, self-contained document (`<!doctype html>` through
`</html>`) exactly as you want it rendered.

## 4. Roll back without re-pushing

If a pushed revision is bad, don't re-push the old content — that fabricates
a new revision instead of recording what actually happened. Roll the
current pointer back to any prior revision by id:

```bash
curl -sk https://host.docker.internal:8080/api/missions/<mission_id>/site/revisions/<revision_id>/activate -X POST
# → {"revision": {"revision_id": "<revision_id>", "revision_seq": N, ...}}
```

## 5. Other routes

```bash
GET    /api/missions                                              # list all missions
GET    /api/missions/<mission_id>                                 # mission + current revision metadata
DELETE /api/missions/<mission_id>                                 # hard-delete a mission and its full history
GET    /api/missions/<mission_id>/site                            # current revision, metadata AND content together
GET    /api/missions/<mission_id>/site/revisions                  # history (no content — id, seq, note, byte size, created_at)
GET    /api/missions/<mission_id>/site/revisions/<revision_id>    # one historical revision, full content
```

No `GET .../status` vs `.../full` split, no membership-set indirection, no
`graph set remove` needed for deletion — `DELETE /api/missions/<id>` is a
real route.
